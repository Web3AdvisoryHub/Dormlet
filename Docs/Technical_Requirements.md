# Dormlet Technical Requirements

## System Architecture Overview

Dormlet requires a comprehensive architecture that integrates Web3 technologies with interactive 3D environments and social features. The system will be built using a modern tech stack that balances performance, scalability, and user experience.

## Core Technical Components

### 1. Frontend Technologies
- **Framework**: React.js with Next.js for server-side rendering and optimized performance
- **3D Rendering**: Three.js for WebGL-based 3D rendering of virtual spaces
- **State Management**: Redux or Context API for application state
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions and scroll effects

### 2. Backend Technologies
- **Server**: Node.js with Express for API endpoints
- **Database**: MongoDB for user data and space configurations
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.io for real-time user interactions
- **Authentication**: JWT for traditional auth, combined with Web3 wallet authentication
- **Cloud Storage**: AWS S3 or similar for asset storage

### 3. Web3 Integration
- **Wallet Connection**: ethers.js or web3.js for wallet integration
- **NFT Fetching**: APIs to fetch NFT metadata from various chains
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity contracts for any on-chain functionality
- **IPFS Integration**: For decentralized storage of space configurations

### 4. DevOps Requirements
- **Hosting**: AWS, Google Cloud, or similar cloud provider
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment
- **Monitoring**: Sentry for error tracking, Google Analytics for usage metrics
- **Containerization**: Docker for consistent deployment environments

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Wallet Integration
- Connect multiple wallet types (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
- Authenticate users via wallet signatures
- Fetch owned NFTs across multiple chains
- Handle wallet disconnection and reconnection gracefully

### 2. NFT Display and Interaction
- Parse NFT metadata from various standards
- Render NFTs as 3D objects within virtual spaces
- Enable interaction with NFT objects
- Support different NFT types (images, 3D models, audio, etc.)

### 3. Scroll-Core Interface
- Implement vertical scrolling between different spaces
- Create smooth transitions between scroll view and 3D view
- Optimize performance for mobile devices
- Support touch gestures and mouse interactions

### 4. Avatar System
- Create customizable user avatars
- Support avatar movement within spaces
- Enable avatar interactions with environment and other users
- Potentially integrate NFT-based avatar components

### 5. Social Features
- Real-time presence of multiple users in spaces
- Chat functionality (text, possibly voice)
- Friend/follow system
- Space sharing and invitations

### 6. Space Creation and Customization
- Tools for arranging NFTs within spaces
- Templates for different space types
- Customization of lighting, textures, and environment
- Saving and loading space configurations

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Performance Optimization
- **Challenge**: Rendering multiple 3D objects and avatars while maintaining performance
- **Solution**: Implement level-of-detail rendering, asset compression, and progressive loading

### 2. Cross-Chain NFT Support
- **Challenge**: Fetching and displaying NFTs from multiple blockchains
- **Solution**: Integrate with aggregation services like Moralis or build custom adapters for each chain

### 3. Mobile Compatibility
- **Challenge**: Providing a good experience on lower-powered mobile devices
- **Solution**: Implement fallback rendering modes and optimize asset loading

### 4. Real-time Synchronization
- **Challenge**: Keeping multiple users in sync within the same space
- **Solution**: Implement efficient real-time protocols with conflict resolution

### 5. NFT Rendering Standardization
- **Challenge**: Handling various NFT formats and metadata standards
- **Solution**: Create adapter patterns for different NFT types and standards

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add analytics and monitoring

## Initial Development Roadmap

1. **Week 1-2**: Setup development environment, implement basic wallet connection
2. **Week 3-4**: Develop 3D rendering engine and scroll interface
3. **Week 5-6**: Implement NFT fetching and display
4. **Week 7-8**: Create space customization tools
5. **Week 9-10**: Develop avatar system and multi-user presence
6. **Week 11-12**: Implement social features and real-time communication
7. **Week 13-14**: Testing, optimization, and polish

## Required Skills and Resources

- Frontend developers with React and Three.js experience
- Backend developers with Node.js and WebSocket experience
- Web3 developers familiar with wallet integration and NFT standards
- 3D artists for environment and avatar design
- UI/UX designers for interface design
- DevOps engineers for deployment and scaling

This technical requirements document provides a comprehensive overview of what's needed to build the Dormlet application. The next step would be to set up the development environment and begin implementing the core functionality.
